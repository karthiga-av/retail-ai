# 💰 Retail AI Advisor (RAG-based Financial Assistant)

## 📌 Project Description
Retail AI Advisor is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based application that allows users to upload financial documents (PDF/TXT) and interact with them through a chat interface.

The system processes documents, converts them into embeddings, and retrieves relevant context to generate accurate, context-aware responses using a Large Language Model.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project
- Build an intelligent financial assistant using RAG architecture  
- Provide context-based answers instead of generic LLM responses  
- Reduce hallucination by grounding responses in uploaded documents  
- Simulate real-world AI systems used in finance and customer support
